# AI-Driving-Game

## Description

This is a program inspired by CodeBullet on youtube. The `main.py` program uses the pygame library to create a driving game, complete with drifting mechanics. The `agent.py` program uses Deep Q Learning to iteratively improve a Neural Network model, making the AI better at the driving game. The logic of the Neural Network is found in `model.py`. The models are stored in the `/model` folder.

## Installation

2. Install requirements using pip:
```
pip -r install requirements.txt
```

## Running the project

1. Navigate to the root of the project
2. Run
```python
python agent.py
```
    to run the Deep Q Learning Algorithm on the amge
If you wish to play the game yourself:
```python
python main.py
```
