# AI-Driving-Game

## Description

This is a program inspired by Code Bullet on Youtube. This program trains a Neural Network to play a driving game.

The `main.py` program uses the pygame library to implement the driving game, complete with drifting mechanics. The `agent.py` program uses Deep Q Learning to iteratively improve a Neural Network model, making the AI better at the driving game. The logic of the Neural Network is found in `model.py`, and the models are stored in the `/model` folder.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Install requirements using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the project

1. Navigate to the root of the project
2. Run
```python
python agent.py
```
to run the Deep Q Learning Algorithm on the game.

**Or**

```python
python main.py
```
to play the driving game yourself

## Additional Information

In the `main.py` file, you can increase the value of `FPS` on line 28 to increase the speed the AI plays the game. Feel free to also change the hyperparameter values (found in lines 11-23 in `agent.py`) of the Deep Q Learning model.
